    <p>

        Cauliflower soup is delicious, warming and incredibly easy to make. 
        All it takes to make are a few vegetables, (including of course cauliflower), 
        thrown into a pot of water with usually chicken stock, dill, black pepper and that's it,
        just leave it to boil for a couple of hours and it's done.
        Serve with a teaspoon of sour cream which gives it its defining eauropean flavour.
