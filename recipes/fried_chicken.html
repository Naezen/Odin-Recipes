        Another favourite of mine, it can be messy to prepare but so satisfying when complete.
        I use Polish chicken seasoning to give the chicken an incredible flavour but you can use whatever spices you prefer.
        Served with steamed broccoli and boiled potatoes, garnished with dill, and butter, this dish feels clean and filling.
