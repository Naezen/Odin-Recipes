    <p>
        Another very simple meal to make, a chili con carne will fill you up with next to no effort at all.
        Using very few ingredients the only vegetable to prepare is a single onion.
        Honestly, all the flavour comes from the red kidney beans in chilli sauce.
        One caveat when it comes to the rice, please use a rice cooker. the rice comes out perfect every time.
